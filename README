REGGIT
Author: Kevin Ngo

The Reggit is the OSU registration frontend. It is written in Django using the reglib as a backend library. Although it is Django, there is no use of databases therefore no models. There is simply one small view files and a bunch of templates. Because all of the logic is done in the backend, there is not much need in many views.

When changing the backend and checking the changes in the frontend, remember to reinstall the backend package and logout/login to Reggit again because all of the data is initialized on login. The data does not change dynamically like that.
